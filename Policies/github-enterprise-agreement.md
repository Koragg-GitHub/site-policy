### SECTION A: GITHUB ENTERPRISE - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

This Section A sets forth the terms and conditions applicable to your use of any of the Products.

#### 1. Definitions

"Affiliate" means any entity that directly or indirectly owns or controls, is owned or controlled by, or is under common ownership or control with a Party where "ownership" or "control" means having more than fifty percent (50%) voting power of the controlled entity.

"Effective Date" is the earlier of the date on which you (i) agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as described above, or (ii) first place an Order for the Products.

"Fees" means the fees you are required to pay GitHub to (i) use the Products during the applicable Subscription Term or (ii) receive Professional Services, as such fees are reflected on an Order Form or SOW.

"GitHub Partner" means a company authorized to resell Products under GitHub's Channel Partner Agreement.

"Order Form" means written or electronic documentation (including a quote) that the Parties use to order the Products. The Order Form will specify the authorized scope of use for the Products, which may include: (i) license type, (ii) number and type of Seats, (iii) number of production instances, (iv) Subscription Term, or (v) other restrictions or special terms (collectively, the "Scope of Use"). Upon execution by the Parties (or, in the case of electronic orders, confirmation and placement of the order), each Order Form will be subject to the terms of this Agreement.

"Parties" means, collectively, GitHub and you. Each may be referred to individually as a "Party."

"Professional Services" means training, consulting, or implementation services that GitHub provides to you pursuant to a mutually executed SOW. Services do not include Support.

"Professional Services Credits" means the upfront payment method for purchasing Professional Services (exclusive of travel and lodging expenses) that you may use over a period of twelve (12) months (unless otherwise stated in an Order Form) for Professional Services. Any Professional Services Credits that remain unused at the end of twelve (12) months from the date of purchase (or as otherwise stated in an Order Form) are automatically cancelled and are non-refundable.

"Seats" means the number of User accounts for GitHub Enterprise that you are authorized to create. You may only provision one Seat per User across GitHub Enterprise Server and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For clarity, once you provision a Seat to a User, you will not be authorized to bifurcate the Seat so that one User can use a Seat on GitHub Enterprise Server while another User uses the same Seat on GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

"SOW" means a mutually executed statement of work detailing the Professional Services GitHub will perform for you, any related Fees, and each Party's related obligations.

"Subscription Term" means one (1) year from the applicable effective date of an Order or as stated in the Order Form.

#### 2. Payment

**2.1 Fees.** You agree to pay the Fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars (or Professional Services Credits, if applicable), unless otherwise specified in an Order Form or unless purchasing through an authorized third party (in which case, payment terms will be agreed upon between you and the authorized third party). You must pay the Fees within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice that GitHub sends to you related to the applicable Order Form or SOW. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as provided in Sections A.3.2, A.4.1 and B.12.1. If you fail to pay any Fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable Order Form or SOW. You are solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

**2.2 Professional Services Credits.** If you use Professional Services Credits as the means of payment for Professional Services, then upon your receipt of an SOW, the applicable Professional Services Credits will be deducted from your Professional Services Credits balance. You are responsible for ensuring that your purchase order ("PO") issued to GitHub for the Professional Services reflects the pricing set forth in the SOW. If there is any difference in pricing listed in the SOW and the pricing listed in the PO, the pricing in the SOW will control. The Parties agree that SOWs payable via Professional Services Credits do not have to be signed by either Party to be valid and enforceable. Subject to the SOW, all Fees paid by you are non-refundable and all Professional Services Credits must be used within the time set forth in the Order Form or will automatically be cancelled and are non-refundable. You may not apply Professional Services Credits to travel and lodging expenses, which must be invoiced separately.

#### 3.  Professional Services

**3.1 Professional Services.** Upon your request for Professional Services, GitHub will provide a statement of work detailing such Professional Services. Each SOW is binding upon execution by the Parties and any Professional Services will be governed by the terms of the applicable SOW and this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any SOW, the terms of this Agreement will control. GitHub will perform the Professional Services described in each SOW according to the timeframes set forth in such SOW. GitHub will control the manner and means by which the Professional Services are performed and reserves the right to determine which personnel is/are assigned to perform the Professional Services.

To the extent GitHub delivers anything to you during the course of performing the Professional Services, GitHub grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free, limited-term license to use those deliverables during the term of this Agreement, solely in conjunction with your use of the Software.

**3.2 Limited Warranty.** Unless otherwise set forth in an SOW, GitHub warrants that any Professional Services performed under this Agreement will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner by appropriately qualified personnel. GitHub's only obligation, and your only remedy, for a breach of this warranty will be, at GitHub's option and expense, to either: (i) promptly re-perform any Professional Services that fail to meet this warranty or (ii) if the breach cannot be cured, terminate the SOW and refund the unused prepaid Fees.

#### 6. Confidentiality

**6.1 Definition of Confidential Information.** For the purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" means all non-public information disclosed by either Party to the others, whether in writing, orally or by other means, designated as confidential or that the receiving Party knows or reasonably should know, under the circumstances surrounding the disclosure and the nature of the information, is confidential to the disclosing Party. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the source code of the Software will be deemed to be GitHub's Confidential Information, regardless of whether it is marked as such. For the avoidance of doubt, no content posted on the Website or Service will be considered Confidential Information unless such content is stored solely in your private repositories on the Service.

**6.2 Exclusions.** Confidential Information does not include any information that (i) was or becomes publicly known through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) was rightfully known or becomes rightfully known to the receiving party without confidential or proprietary restriction from a source other than the disclosing party who has a right to disclose it; (iii) is approved by the disclosing party for disclosure without restriction in a written document which is signed by a duly authorized officer of such disclosing party; (iv) the receiving party independently develops without access to or use of the other Party's Confidential Information; or (v) subject to Section C.5, is or has been stored or posted on the Website or Service and outside of your private repositories.

Each Party agrees to maintain in confidence and protect the other Party's Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care as it uses for its own information of a similar nature, but in any event at least a reasonable degree of care. Each Party agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized disclosure of the other Party's Confidential Information, including, without limitation, disclosing such Confidential Information only to its employees, independent contractors, consultants, and legal and financial advisors (collectively, "Representatives") who (i) have a need to know such information, (ii) are parties to appropriate agreements sufficient to comply with this Section A.6, and (iii) are informed of the restrictions on use and disclosure set forth in this Section A.6. Each Party is responsible for all acts and omissions of its Representatives. The foregoing obligations will not restrict either Party from disclosing Confidential Information of the other Party pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body, *provided* that the Party required to make such a disclosure gives reasonable notice to the other Party to enable such Party to contest such order or requirement. The restrictions set forth in this Section A.6 will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

#### 7. Term and Termination

**7.1 Term.** This Agreement starts on the Effective Date and will continue in effect until terminated by a Party in accordance with this Section A.7, subject to Section A.7.4.

**7.2 Termination for Convenience.** Either Party may terminate an Order Form or this Agreement, with or without cause, upon at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice.

**7.3 Termination for Material Breach.** Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice if the other Party breaches a material obligation under this Agreement and fails to cure the breach within thirty (30) days from the date it receives notification. Either Party reserves the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice, but without giving the other Party a cure period, as follows: if you breach any of the terms of this Agreement relating to GitHub's intellectual property (including your non-compliance with the license grant or any license restrictions) or either Party breaches its confidentiality obligations.

**7.4 Effect of Termination; Survival.** Upon termination of this Agreement, you may not execute additional Order Forms; however, this Agreement will remain in effect for the remainder of any active Order Forms. When an Order Form terminates or expires, as to that Order Form: (i) the Subscription Term for the Software and/or Service will immediately end; (ii) you will no longer have the right to use the Software or the Service, and any Licenses or access granted in the Order Form will automatically cease to exist as of the date of termination or expiration; (iii) if any Fees were owed prior to termination, you must pay those Fees immediately; (iv) you must destroy all copies of the Software in your possession or control, and certify in writing to GitHub that you have done so; and (v) each Party will promptly return to the other (or, if the other party requests it, destroy) all Confidential Information belonging to the other to the extent permitted by the Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may continue to access the Software to migrate your data and may request migration of the data in your repositories for up to ninety (90) days after termination or expiration of this Agreement or an Order Form; however, you may not use the Software on a production basis during that time. Any provisions which by their nature should reasonably survive will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement or an Order Form.

You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections C.4.4 through 4.6. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions its need to run the Service, no additional license is required.

**4.4 License Grant to GitHub.** You grant to GitHub the right to store, parse, and display Customer Content, and make incidental copies as  necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy Customer Content to GitHub's database and make backups; display Customer Content to you and those you choose to show it to; parse Customer Content into a search index or otherwise analyze it on GitHub's servers; share Customer Content with Other Users you choose to share it with; and perform Customer Content, in case it is something like music or video. These rights apply to both public and private repositories. This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Customer Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service. To the extent any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable under Section A.8, you grant to GitHub the rights it needs to use Customer Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Customer Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

**4.5 License Grant to Other Users.**

(i) Any User-Generated Content you or your Users post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to Other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others.

If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

**4.7 Moral Rights.** You retain all moral rights to Customer Content that you or your Users upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against GitHub, solely to enable it to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section C.4.4, but not otherwise.

#### 5. Private Repositories

**5.1 Control of Private Repositories.** Some Accounts, such as paid Accounts, may have private repositories, which allow a User to control access to Content.

You are responsible for managing access to your private repositories, including invitations to such private repositories, administrative control of Organizations and teams, and termination of access to such private repositories.

**5.2 Confidentiality of Private Repositories.** GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you.

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example, you may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Customer Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those it needs to provide the Service, GitHub will provide an explanation of those rights.

**5.4 Exclusions.** If GitHub has reason to believe the contents of a private repository are in violation of the law or of this Agreement, it has the right to access, review, and remove them. Additionally, GitHub may be [compelled by law](/articles/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

#### 12. Additional Terms relating to the Service – Privacy, Security, and Service Level Agreement (SLA)

**12.1 Privacy and Security.** The data protection terms set forth in Exhibit D and the security terms set forth in Exhibit E (which include the technical and organizational measures GitHub has in place to protect and secure various types of data) apply to the Service.

**12.2 Service Level Agreement (SLA).**

(i) Program Benefits – Uptime Guarantee and Calculation. GitHub guarantees that the Service will have a quarterly Uptime percentage of 99.95%. That means GitHub's Essential Services will not be interrupted by an Outage affecting more than 50% of Active Users, for more than .05% of the quarter. If GitHub doesn't meet such 99.95% quarterly Uptime guarantee, GitHub may issue Service Credits to customers. GitHub's Uptime calculation is based on the percentage of successful requests it serves through its web, API, and Git client interfaces.

(ii) Exclusions. Exclusions from the Uptime guarantee include Outages resulting from:

-   Scheduled Downtime;

-   Your acts, omissions, or misuse of the Services, including violations of this Agreement;

-   Failures of your internet connectivity;

-   Factors outside GitHub's reasonable control, including Internet access related problems, force majeure events, and third-party services or technology; or

-   Your equipment, services, or other technology.

(iii) Calculation of Uptime Service Credits; Redemption of Uptime Service Credits.

If GitHub's quarterly Uptime percentage drops below its 99.95% Uptime guarantee, then you are entitled to receive a Service Credit equal to 25 times the amount that was paid for the Outage time that exceeds the quarterly Uptime guarantee. Service Credits are calculated at the end of each quarter, and may only be granted upon request.

To find out about GitHub's Uptime percentage, you can request an Uptime report at the end of each quarter.

In order to be granted Service Credits, either an Account Owner or Billing Manager must send a written request, on your behalf, within thirty (30) days of the end of each quarter. Service Credits may not be saved. After being granted a Service Credit, it will be automatically applied to your next bill. Written requests should be sent to [GitHub Support](https://github.com/contact).

**12.3 Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability.** GitHub's [Status Page](https://status.github.com/) is not connected to the Uptime guarantee set forth in this Section and is not an accurate representation of GitHub's Uptime for the purposes of calculating Service Credits. Service Credits are limited to thirty (30) days of paid service, per quarter. Service Credits are your only remedy for any failure by GitHub to meet any Uptime obligations as identified in this Section.

#### 13. Disclaimer of Warranties

GitHub provides the Website and the Service "as is," and "as available" (except as explicitly set forth in Section C.12.2), without warranty of any kind. WITHOUT LIMITING THIS AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, GITHUB EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, REGARDING THE WEBSITE AND THE SERVICE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, SECURITY, ACCURACY, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
